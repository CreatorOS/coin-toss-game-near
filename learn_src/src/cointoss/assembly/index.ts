//Algorithm
// 1. The first person to call the game - creates the game and locks in x amount of NEAR
// 2. After the game is created, game state changes to available and we can see the amount of NEAR locked
// 3. Player 2 can choose amongst a set of available games and lock their near
// 4. Once two players are in, game is set to start
// 5. Once game starts, a random number is generated
// 6. One of the players is randomly asked to make a guess(Can make static for v0)
// 7. Heads - mapped to even number, Tails is mapped to odd number
// 8. Winning player gets total locked amount
// 9. Game state is changed to unavailable/complete
